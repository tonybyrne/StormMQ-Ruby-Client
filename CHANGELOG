0.0.6

  * Update the gemspec to add dependency for Bunny.

0.0.5

  * Re-implemented our AMQP client wrapper so we now use the Bunny
    client for RabbitMQ. Bunny is a synchronous client built upon
    QRack.  Our wrapper provides simple convenience methods for
    obtaining a client instance which is configured with the proper
    vhost based on the StormMQ companyName, systemName and
    environmentName parameters.  Our wrapper returns an instance of
    the Bunny client.

    See: http://github.com/celldee/bunny for details.

0.0.4

  * Initial Public Release.
