NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

  Lists the names of the clusters in our Messaging Cloud you can
  access through your company. You'll need this information if you're
  creating complex system-environment combinations.

  Currently, the only cluster everyone can access is free-1.

  Ordinary users can only access free clusters. If you're sending a
  lot of messages, you might want to use Contended Clusters or
  Co-Located Dedicated Clusters. Please ask us for more information.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <companyName>

  The second form assumes your companyName is the same as your
  userName. This is true for ordinary users.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, this is the same as your userName. If you're
    not sure of your companyName, you can retrieve it with:

    stormmq-list-companies <userName>

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a simple JSON list of strings to STDOUT.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /clusters/<companyName>.

NOTES

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies
