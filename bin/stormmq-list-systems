NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

  Lists the names of all the systems you've created in our Messaging
  Cloud. A system is a logical view of resources. When you activate
  your account, we'll create a default system for you, named the same
  as your userName (we were going to call it default, but we worried
  that'd be too easy to guess). Typically you'd only need one system,
  e.g. 'AccountRocks', 'InflationSwapCalculator', 'Jibbit-X', etc.
  A system has environments. A system-environment pair matches an
  AMQP Virtual Host.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <companyName>

  The second form assumes your companyName is the same as your
  userName. This is true for ordinary users.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, once you activated your account, we created a
    system with the same name as your userName. If you're not sure of
    any systems you've subsequently created you can retrieve them with:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a simple JSON list of strings to STDOUT.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /companies/<companyName>/.

NOTES

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
