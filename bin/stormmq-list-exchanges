PURPOSE

  Describes the currently known exchanges and their state for an
  Environment.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName> <companyName> <environmentName>

  For ordinary users, your companyName is the same as your userName.

  For recently signed up users, the systemName is the same as your
  userName.

  For recently signed up users, the environmentName is one of:

  * development
  * testing
  * production

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <systemName>

    If you're not sure if you've already created a system, use:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

    A systemName can not contain a '/' or ':'

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, this is the same as your userName.
    If you're not sure of your companyName, you can retrieve it with:

    stormmq-list-companies <userName>

  <environmentName>

    One of:

    * development
    * testing
    * production

    For the default system created when you signed up, or for any
    system created by stormmq-create-system <userName>
    (except advanced use).

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a pretty-printed complex JSON list to STDOUT.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /companies/<companyName>/<systemName>/<environmentName>/exchanges/.

NOTES

  Output is not JSON, so not suitable for use with XHTML, etc, response documents.

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
