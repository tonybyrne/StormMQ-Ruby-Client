PURPOSE

 A system is a logical view of resources in our Messaging Cloud.
 Typically you'd only need one system, eg 'AccountRocks',
 'InflationSwapCalculator', 'Jibbit-X', etc. A system has
 environments.

 A company-system-environment triplet matches an AMQP Virtual Host.
 E.g., if your company is widgetcorp, your system is accountrock and
 you want to use an environment of development, your AMQP virtual
 host name is widgetcorp/accountrock/development.

 If you've just signed up as an ordinary user, then we've already
 created a system called <userName>for you (see stormmq-list-systems),
 with an AMQP virtual host called /<userName>/<userName>/development,
 accessible at amqp.stormmq.com.

 All AMQP virtual hosts are virtually hosted on amqp.stormmq.com.

 To find the passwords to log onto them with AMQP, use:

 stormmq-get-amqpuser-password

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName> <companyName>

  The second form assumes your companyName and systemName is the same
  as your userName. This is true for ordinary users who've just
  signed up.

  The third form assumes your companyName is the same as your
  userName. This is true for ordinary users.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <systemName>

    If you're not sure if you've already created a system, use:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

    A systemName can not contain a '/' or ':'

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, this is the same as your userName. If you're
    not sure of your companyName, you can retrieve it with:

    stormmq-list-companies <userName>

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a pretty-printed complex JSON list to standard out.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /companies/<companyName>/<systemName>.

NOTES

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
