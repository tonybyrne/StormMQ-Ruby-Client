NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

  Describes all the details we have for your company, including every
  single connection you've made to our Messaging Cloud, how much
  bandwidth you've used, your current account credits and debits and
  invoice contact details. Some of the details of this API are in
  flux. We'd like your feedback in the forums on how to improve it!

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <companyName>

  The second form assumes your companyName is the same as your
  userName. This is true for ordinary users.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, this is the same as your userName. If you're
    not sure of your companyName, you can retrieve it with:

    stormmq-list-companies <userName>

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a simple JSON list of strings to STDOUT.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /companies/<companyName>/.

NOTES

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
