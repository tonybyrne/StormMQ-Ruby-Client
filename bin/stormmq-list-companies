NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

  Lists the names of all the companies you belong to. Ordinary users
  belong to only one company. For ordinary users, your userName is
  the same as your companyName. For example, if you signed up as
  'bob', then your userName is bob and your company is bob.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with. When provided, lists
    the companies associated with that user name.

    Note:

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs a simple JSON list of strings to STDOUT.

REST API

  Equivalent is 'GET /companies/'.

NOTES

  Use #{File.basename(__FILE__)} to find your companyName for
  use with the other tools.

  Security prevents you from obtaining information about which other
  users belong to which companies.
