NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

 Deletes systems PERMANENTLY, with no chance of recovery. You can
 recreate the system, of course, if you kept your settings.
 You will just lose any messages in the meantime.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName>
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName> <companyName>

  The second form assumes your companyName and systemName is the same
  as your userName. This is true for ordinary users who've just
  signed up.

  The third form assumes your companyName is the same as your
  userName. This is true for ordinary users.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <systemName>

    If you're not sure if you've already created a system, use:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

    A systemName can not contain a '/' or ':'

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, this is the same as your userName. If you're
    not sure of your companyName, you can retrieve it with:

    stormmq-list-companies <userName>

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs nothing.

REST API

  Equivalent is DELETE /companies/<companyName>/<systemName>.

NOTES

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
