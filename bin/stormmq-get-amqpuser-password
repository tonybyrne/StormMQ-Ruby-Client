NAME

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)}

PURPOSE

  Gets the password for a given AMQP user name. For a recently signed
  up user, we've created you a default system with a default AMQP
  user name (amqpUserName) the same as your userName. This is the
  only tool you'll need initially.

USAGE

  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} --help
  #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <userName> <systemName> <companyName> <environmentName> <amqpUserName>

  For ordinary users, your companyName is the same as your userName.

  For recently signed up users, the systemName is the same as your
  userName.

  For recently signed up users, the environmentName is one of:

  * development
  * testing
  * production

  For recently signed up users, the amqpUserName is the same as your
  userName.

PARAMETERS

  <userName>

    The user name you log into the site with.

  <systemName>

    If you're not sure if you've already created a system, use:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

    A systemName can not contain a '/' or ':'

  <companyName>

    For ordinary users, once you activated your account, we created a
    system with the same name as your userName. If you're not sure of
    any systems you've subsequently created you can retrieve them with:

    stormmq-list-systems <userName>

  <environmentName>

    One of:

    * development
    * testing
    * production

    For the default system created when you signed up, or for any
    system created by stormmq-create-system <userName>
    (except advanced use).

  <amqpUserName>

    This is your userName for the default system we created when you
    signed up, or for any system created by
    stormmq-create-system <userName> (except advanced use).

  --help, -h

    Displays this help page then quits.

RESULT

  Outputs just one string which is your AMQP password for the
  amqpUserName. Use this to log on with.

REST API

  Equivalent is GET /companies/<companyName>/<systemName>/<environmentName>/users/<amqpUserName>.

NOTES

  Output is not JSON, so not suitable for use with XHTML, etc, response documents.

  To find you companyName, use:

    stormmq-list-companies

  To delete your default system, use:

    stormmq-delete-system <userName>

  To create a new system, use:

    stormmq-create-system <userName> <systemName>
